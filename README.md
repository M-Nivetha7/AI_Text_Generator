# 🧠 AI Text Generator  
A simple yet powerful **Generative AI** project that combines both **Bigram-based text generation** and a **GPT-style model** to create meaningful, context-aware text.  
This project also includes an **interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time text generation.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔤 **Bigram Model** – Learns from input text and generates sequences based on statistical probabilities  
- 🤖 **GPT-based Generator** – Uses a modern neural model for high-quality text  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App** – Clean UI for writing, generating, and experimenting with AI-generated text  
- 📁 **Input & Output Logging** – Reads `input.txt`, writes logs to `output.log`  
- 🧩 Modular Python scripts for easy customization

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Nivetha7/AI_Text_Generator.git
cd AI_Text_Generator

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py


🧪 Usage
Once the Streamlit UI opens:


✍️ Enter a prompt


⚙️ Choose model type (Bigram or GPT)


🚀 Click Generate Text


📄 View, copy, or log the generated output



📘 How It Works
🔹 Bigram Model
A statistical method that predicts the next word based on the previous one. Helps understand classical NLP techniques.
🔹 GPT Model
A neural network–based generator that produces more coherent and meaningful text based on patterns learned from the dataset.

✨ Learning Outcomes


Understanding classical vs modern text generation


Building an end-to-end AI pipeline


Working with probability-based and deep learning models


Creating interactive apps using Streamlit


Logging outputs for iterative testing
